Tesla Model 3 Battery Thermal Management Analysis
📋 Project Overview
This MATLAB simulation performs comprehensive thermal analysis of the Tesla Model 3 Long Range battery pack for the MEF317: Engines, Motors & Mobility course assignment. The code analyzes heat generation across multiple operating scenarios and validates the liquid cooling thermal management system design.
🎯 Purpose
This simulation calculates:

Heat generation during city, highway, performance driving, and DC fast charging
Thermal resistance network modeling from cell core to coolant
Cell temperature predictions under various load conditions
Coolant system performance and temperature rise
Design validation against safety limits (45°C maximum cell temperature)

🔧 Requirements

MATLAB R2018b or later
No additional toolboxes required
Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
